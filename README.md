Connecticut Open Communities Alliance housing mobility tools

# Demo versions (in-progress)

## Mobility App for housing mobility counselors and clients
http://jackdougherty.github.io/oca-housing-mobility-map/index.html

TO DO:
- if possible, display transportation options between new address and 2nd address (work, school, etc.) and integrate Google Directions API as another map layer. See Google Routes sample code (https://github.com/JackDougherty/Google_Routes) and live demo (http://jackdougherty.github.io/Google_Routes/) See also NON-FUNCTIONAL MOCKUP for desired placement of 2nd address (http://jackdougherty.github.io/oca-housing-mobility-map/index-2-addresses.html)
- Erin to decide about Places of Worship data
- Erin/Jack to add explanatory text and links to source data (preferably point to Google Fusion Tables for public download)

## Opportunity and Race Map
http://jackdougherty.github.io/oca-housing-mobility-map/index_minorityMap.html

TO DO:
- if possible, display town labels on this interactive map. Natalia says not possible to do so as a separate KML layer

## Overall
- make sure that Erin has access and skills to modify Google Fusion Table data points; access to GitHub code to embed on her website
